# MonogameTraining
Training using monogame video tutorials

In this project you can find the binaryes of a first monogame training project. 

Following the tutorial I:

* Instanced a texture 2D and showed it in a monogame viewport.
* Made the texture to move on the screeen un til the point its possition overcome the window width.
* I learned practicing how the fps (frames per second) can be fixed or not, and how it can be displayed at the window tittle.
